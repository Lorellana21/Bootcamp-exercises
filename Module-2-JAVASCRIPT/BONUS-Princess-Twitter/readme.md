# Princess Twitter

We have come up with a very interesting project: to make a social network! But not just any social network, for normal people there is already Twitter and Instagram. We have been asked to make a social network for Disney princesses ❤️, a place where they can connect and understand each other with their typical day-to-day problems that we would never understand...

Our client has given us a URL from which we must extract the data, as they have set up the back and we only have to paint the information on the front.

**FLOW**: When loading the page we have to paint a list of princesses with the following information:

- Name
- Photo
- Comment of the princess

By clicking on a princess we can change the background to light blue to mark her as our friend.

We will extract the data from the following [URL]('https://beta.adalab.es/ejercicios-extra/js-fetch-arrays-princesas-disney/data/users.json') Example of object coming from the server:

```
{
   "name":"Ariel del Mar",
   "email":"dangerousRedHair@example.com",
   "phone":"0424-4724697",
   "comment":"Ahora que estamos en fase 3 ¿Alguna amigui se apunta a una mariscada el Sábado?",
   "picture":"http://beta.adalab.es/ejercicio-fin-de-semana-promo-j/data/images/ariel.jpg"
}
```
